# immo_eliza_API# Immo Eliza Project: Property Value Estimation

## Description

This project aims to create an advanced AI model capable of estimating the value of houses and apartments for sale in Belgium based on information provided by users. With this AI-powered solution, potential buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals can access property worth predictions to make better decisions on the dynamic currently real estate market.

The development process is thoughtfully divided into four parts, each addressing crucial aspects of the project:

**Part 1:** *Data Acquisition*

In the first part of the project, it was performed a web scraping to acquire a dataset with the data of approximately 10,000 properties. After this, the data is saved in a CSV file named dataset-immo.csv and stored in the folder data.

**Part 2:** *Data Cleaning, Analysis, and Interpretation*

The second part of the project involves data cleaning, analysis, and interpretation. The acquired dataset is processed to handle missing values, outliers, inconsistencies, and irrelevant information to ensures that the dataset is in a suitable state for further analysis. Next, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is carried out to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics. Through statistical calculations, visualizations, and data summarization, important features are identified, relationships between variables, and potential predictors of property value. The insights obtained during this phase guide the development of the AI model.

**Part 3:** *Machine Learning with Random Forest Regressor*

In the third part of the project, a machine learning model using the Random Forest Regressor is created. This ensemble learning algorithm is well-suited for regression tasks and can handle numerical and categorical features. The relevant features based on the insights gained from Part 2 were selected and the dataset was further splitted into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the Random Forest Regressor to learn the relationships between features and property values. After training, the model's accuracy was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) score. The R2 score indicates how well the model fits the data, providing valuable information about its performance.

**Part 4:** *Model Deployment and Integration*

In the final part, it was deployed the AI model as an API using FastAPI and it was containerized with Docker for portability. The AI model is accessible through a public URL with personalized port on Render. Users can make property value estimations by sending data to the API and receiving the results in real-time. This integration and deployment process make the property value estimation AI model a practical and user-friendly tool for potential property buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in Belgium.
