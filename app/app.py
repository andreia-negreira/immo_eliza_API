Here is how the route POST works and what you need to do:\n

1. It is expected from you that you enter all the data correctly, respecting the types;\n
2. For the features bellow, you have to enter the following options:\n
type_property: "APARTMENT" or "HOUSE"\n
subtype_property: "CASTLE", "EXCEPTIONAL_PROPERTY", "MANSION", "VILLA", "MANOR_HOUSE", "OTHER_PROPERTY", "APARTMENT_BLOCK",\n
                  "PENTHOUSE", "FARMHOUSE", "MIXED_USE_BUILDING", "TRIPLEX", "LOFT", "DUPLEX", "COUNTRY_COTTAGE", "HOUSE",\n

state_building: "AS_NEW", "JUST_RENOVATED", "GOOD", "TO_BE_DONE_UP", "TO_RENOVATE", "TO_RESTORE"\n
3. For the location, the first letter has to be capitalized;\n
4. For the other features, please enter 0 for no and 1 for yes.\n

And that is it!\n

Now, please, grab your coffee and enjoy receiving a prediction by the click of your mouse! ;)'''
